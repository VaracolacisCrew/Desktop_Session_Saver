## INTRODUCTION
This is a little tool that stores a session of all desktop window position and sizes to be able to change resolutions and keep the desktop arrangement.

Since you store this info in session files (.ses) you can have multiple arrangements saved and load them as
necessary.

&nbsp;

## NOTE
Even tho this saves the window size and position of all visible windows, this app can't restore them if they are closed. 

May be this is something I'll do in the future.
